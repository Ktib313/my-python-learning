# My Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my personal progress as I learn and practice Python.  
It is organized into two main sections:

- **Python Exercises** — small, focused scripts to practice specific concepts.
- **Mini Projects** — practical projects that help me apply what I'm learning.

The goal of this repository is to improve my Python skills through consistent practice, hands-on problems, and real project structures. It also helps me build experience with Git and GitHub.
